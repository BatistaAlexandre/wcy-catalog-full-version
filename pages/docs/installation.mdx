# Installation

Before you start installing DashTail, make sure you have a folder ready where you can open the downloaded `.zip` file.

## Choose a version to install:

When you unzip the .zip file you got from ThemeForest, you'll see two more .zip files along with some other files. One of them is called the Demo version, and the other one is the Starter version:

#### 1. Demo: `DashTail-vX.X.X.zip`

This `.zip` file has the Demo version inside, which has all the apps, pages, and UI sections from the Demo app.

#### 2. Starter: `DashTail-starter-vX.X.X.zip`

This `.zip` file has the Starter version inside, which has all the main parts and features of DashTail, but without the Demo apps, pages, and UI sections. Use the Starter version to build your app on top.

## Start Installation:

  Note: This command will take a while to execute and will install all the
  necessary libraries into the node_modules directory, enabling you to start
  developing.

### Step 3

To start the project on your computer, set up the development server, and watch for any code changes, type either

```bash
///npm
npm run dev

///yarn
yarn dev

You can view the project at `http://localhost:3000`.
