    ##### Q: What is a Regular License?

    A: A [Regular License](https://themeforest.net/licenses/terms/regular) is designed for a single end-product that is free for end-users. This license is suitable for both personal and client projects. Note that each end-product or domain requires its own Regular License.

    ##### Q: Can you explain the Extended License?

    A: An [Extended License](https://themeforest.net/licenses/terms/extended) is needed for a single end-product that involves charging end-users, such as with a subscription model or in a marketplace. This applies to both your own projects and those developed for clients. Each end-product or domain usage demands a separate Extended License.
