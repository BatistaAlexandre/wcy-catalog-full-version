# New Page

Making a new page is incredibly simple in DashTail. Here's an example of how to create your own custom page and set it up according to your needs.




### Creating a new page

To create a new page, make a new .js or .jsx file inside the app folder. You can also create a page within a subfolder of the app folder. For instance, `app/foldername/page.jsx`.




```js filename="app/foldername/page.jsx" /children/
const About = () => {
  return (
    <div class="about">
      <h1>About</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```
