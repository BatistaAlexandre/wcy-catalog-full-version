# Quick Start

## Get Your Access

DashTail, a high-quality template available on ThemeForest, requires the purchase of a license for access to its source code. After acquiring a license, you can download the source directly from the "Downloads" section within your ThemeForest account.

## Inside the Zip

Once you unzip the file you downloaded from ThemeForest, you'll see three folders: DashTail-vX.X.X.zip, DashTail-starter-vX.X.X.zip, and Documentation.

## DashTail-vX.X.X.zip

The DashTail-vX.X.X.zip Package encompasses all the files showcased in the live [demo](http://dastail.codeshaper.net/), including all layouts, apps, pages, components, and elements. You can copy the necessary things from there and then use them on your project.

   If you want to use the Demo package then you may need to remove things that you don't use or replace them with your content.

## DashTail-starter-vX.X.X.zip

The Starter Kit is a simple version of DashTail, without any extra demo content. It contains only the essential elements you need to begin creating your app.

If you want to use third-party libraries with the Starter Kit, don't worry about setting them up. Our template is very flexible. Check out how you can get started with the [Starter Kit](/docs/starter-kit).


## Documentation

Documentation provides clear instructions and guidance to help you navigate through DashTail effortlessly.
