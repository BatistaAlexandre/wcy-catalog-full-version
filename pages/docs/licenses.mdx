# Standard Licenses

The majority of our items (themes, code, graphics, 3D and flash) are covered by our Standard Licenses. If your end product including the item is going to be free to the end user then a **_[Regular License](https://themeforest.net/licenses/terms/regular)_** is what you need. An **_[Extended License](https://themeforest.net/licenses/terms/extended)_** is required if the end user must pay to use the end product.
