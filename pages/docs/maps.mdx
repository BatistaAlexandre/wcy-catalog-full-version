# Maps

## React Leaflet

[React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) provides bindings between React and Leaflet. It does not replace Leaflet, but leverages it to abstract Leaflet layers as React components. As such, it can behave differently from how other React components work.

## Unovis Map Advance

[LeafletMap Advance](https://unovis.dev/gallery/view/?collection=Maps&title=Advanced%20Leaflet%20Map) is a mapping component capable of rendering detailed maps. It doesn't come with preloaded maps, so you'll need to provide a vector tile source first to make it work. You can use an existing cloud map tile server (like MapTiler Cloud, which has a free tier) or host your own tiles (we've successfully used OpenMapTiles in the past).
