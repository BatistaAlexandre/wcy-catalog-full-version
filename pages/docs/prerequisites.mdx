# Prerequisites

Before diving into development with DashTail, ensure your development setup is equipped with Node.js and either npm or Yarn.

##### 1. Node.js (>= 20.0.0)

To install Node.js, go to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and install the latest version.

##### 2. npm (>= 5.5.1) or Yarn (>=1.5.1)

For downloading and installing packages, a package manager is required. You have the option to use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as your package manager. Our preference leans towards **Yarn** over npm. To verify the installation of npm or Yarn on your system, execute `npm -v` or `yarn -v` in a terminal or console window.

```sh
//npm
npm -v

//yarn
yarn -v

```
